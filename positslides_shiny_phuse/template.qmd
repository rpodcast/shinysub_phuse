## Intro {.toc-dark}

- 2005-2010: Full Stack Engineer
- [Joe Cheng | The Past and Future of Shiny | RStudio (2022)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpqLXB_TnpI&ab_channel=PositPBC)
- 2011: Researches & Scientist wanted to share "interactive" statistical concepts with people
- Shiny brought CSS, HTML, JS (Plotly) to Scientist via R
- 2015: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25733352/ mixADA!
- 2018 [R in Pharma](https://rinpharma.com/event/rinpharma2018/) & [Shinymeta](https://towardsdatascience.com/shinymeta-a-revolution-for-reproducibility-bfda6b329f68)
- [2020 GSK](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/driving-agility-in-clinical-reporting-q-a/) & [Future of clinical tfls](https://williamnoble.shinyapps.io/the_future_of_clinical_tfls/)

"We haven’t yet attempted to include a Shiny app in a submission, but this is a very interesting area that GSK and several other companies have been looking at."

## In this talk {.toc-dark}

- Challenge - Modernize the clinical trials process with interactive capabilities
- Solution - Shiny, a popular open source package used by the FDA, Pharmas, Universities & Students
- Impact, Best Practices & Next Steps

## Challenge -  {.toc-light}

- "Janet Woodcock, director of CDER stated that “Reliance On ‘Digitized Paper’ Is Slowing Drug Development” and pharmas are interested in bringing interactive visualization tools as part of the submission process."

- [Best Practice for Interactive Analysis for Submission](https://www.lexjansen.com/css-us/2020/POS_PP16.pdf)


## Change How Reviewers Interface with Data  {.toc-light}

- Change the way a reviewer navigates
- Dive deeper into data points via hyperlinking or mouse overs
- Digest and navigate, with intention, the submission data faster
- Minimize time from question to answer
- Provide control to the decision maker rather than the programmer
- Support Safety Reviews, such as drilling into patient profiles and AEs
- Intuitive interface to perform and analyze simulations of clinical designs

## Shiny  {.toc-light}

- [Six Years of Shiny in Research](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2021/RJ-2021-009/RJ-2021-009.pdf)
- [Evaluation of covariate effects using forest plots and introduction to the coveffectsplot R package](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9574733/)
- "The coveffectsplot package enables the user to control every aspect of the presented intervals using R code or using a point and click interface via the included R Shiny app launched with the “run_interactiveforestplot()” command"
- “The R Shiny application allows the user to easily control the inclusion or exclusion of parameters or covariates, to control the order of presentation of parameters, covariates, and covariate value labels using “drag and drop” interactions. “


## Pharmas & FDA Use R {.30-70-dark}

- [Using R in a Regulatory Environment:
some FDA perspectives](https://www.fcsm.gov/assets/files/docs/gasp/Schuette.pdf)
- [Immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine, sample size is calculated using R package gsDesign (Anderson 2020)](https://covid19crc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mRNA-1273-P301-Protocol-2020.pdf)
- [203093Orig1s000 NDA 2012 Gilead Rstudio/R were used for data analysis](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2014/203093Orig1s000ClinPharmR.pdf)
- [761194Orig1s000 NDA Genzyme Corporation 2021 R & Python](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2021/761194Orig1s000IntegratedR.pdf)
- [Submissions List](https://github.com/philbowsher/Open-Source-in-New-Drug-Applications-NDAs-FDA/blob/main/README.md)



## Pharmas Use Shiny {.toc-dark}

- [PK/PD Analysis](https://www.page-meeting.org/page/page2018/PAGE2018Abstracts.pdf) & [PSI Webinars](https://uat.psiweb.org/events/past-psi-events/2022/10/25/default-calendar/psi-webinar-series-showcasing-r-use-in-pharma)
- Use of Shiny applications within studies in order to minimize work [Biogen-Inc/tidyCDISC](https://github.com/Biogen-Inc/tidyCDISC) & [OSPred AstraZeneca](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/CCI.21.00173)
- [Open-source Technologies in Regulatory Submissions](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Deliverables/Data+Visualisation+%26+Open+Source+Technology/WP057.pdf)
- “Replacing a static submission with a dynamic one that allows for custom and flexible reports and visualizations would be a major improvement for reviewers, not only for verifying the safety and efficacy of a product, but also for expanding on the analysis already done by the sponsor”
- "libraries provide support for dynamic displays that react to
user input. This functionality can collapse the need for dozens
of displays into one, allowing the user to interrogate data as they
need to"
